          <h2>Kozhikode</h2>
          <p>
            Kozhikode District was the capital of the erstwhile kingdom of the mighty Zamorins and once a renowned commercial center. Today Kozhikode is one of the best cities in Kerala. Endowed with lush green countrysides, serene beaches, historic sites, wildlife sanctuaries, rivers, and hills, this city enchants both its inhabitants and its guests. With its unique culture and friendly ambiance, Kozhikode is a wondrous destination for all.
          </p>
          <p>
            The city of Calicut, the Anglicized form of Kozhikode, is the headquarters of the district. The district of Kozhikode is 38.25% urban and is bordered by Kannur district to the North, Wayanad to the East, and Malappuram to the South. To the West, lies the mighty Arabian Sea. The district is situated between latitudes 11° 08’N and 11° 50’N and longitudes 75°30’E and 76°8’E.
          </p>
          <h2>History of Kozhikode</h2>
          <p>
            Kozhikode also known as Calicut, is a city in the state of Kerala in southern India on the Malabar coast. Kozhikode is the largest urban area in the state and 195th largest urban area in the world. During classical antiquity and the Middle Ages, Kozhikode was dubbed the “City of Spices” for its role as the major trading point of Eastern spices. It was the capital of an independent kingdom ruled by the Samoothiris(Zamorins) in the Middle Ages and later the capital of the erstwhile Malabar district under British rule. Arab merchants traded with the region as early as 7th century, and Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama dropped anchor at Kozhikode on 20 May 1498, thus opening a trade route between Europe and Malabar. A Portuguese factory and fort functioned in Kozhikode for a short period (1511–1525, until the Fall of Calicut). The English landed in 1615 (constructing a trading post in 1665), followed by the French (1698) and the Dutch (1752). In 1765, Mysore captured Kozhikode as part of its occupation of the Malabar Coast.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the city has been known in history under different names, Malayalam speaking communities have traditionally called it Kozhikode. Arab merchants called it Qāliqūṭ. Tamils called it Kallikkottai while for the Chinese it was Kalifo. Although the city’s official name is Kozhikode, in English it is sometimes known by its anglicised version, Calicut. The word calico, a fine variety of hand-woven cotton cloth that was exported from the port of Kozhikode, is thought to have been derived from Calicut
