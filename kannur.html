          <h2>Kannur</h2>
          <p>
            Kannur district derived its name from the location of its headquarters at Kannur town. The old name ‘Cannanore’ is the anglicised form of the Malayalam word Kannur. According to one opinion, ‘Kannur’ is a derivation from Kanathur, an ancient village, the name of which survives even today in one of the wards of Kannur Municipality. Another version is that Kannur might have assumed its name from one of the , deities of the Hindu pantheon, a compound of two words, Kannan (Lord Krishna) and Ur (place) making it the place of Lord Krishna. In this context, it is worth mentioning that the deity of the Katalayi Sreekrishna temple was originally installed in a shrine at Katalayi Kotta in the south eastern part of the present Kannur town.
          </p>
          <h2>History of Kannur</h2>
          <p>
            Cannanore or Kannur is a city and a Municipal Corporation in Kannur district, Kerala, India. This city was once the capital of the Kolattiri Raja who was the chief rival of Zamorin. Cannanore became an important emporium of trade with Persia and Arabia during the 12th and 13th centuries. This era marked the rise of the family of the Ali Rajas or the Sea Kings of Cannanore. Their origin is uncertain but tradition assigns the foundation of the family to a Nayar minister of Kolattiri Raja, who converted to Islam in the beginning of the 12th century
          </p>
          <p>
            Cannanore was one of the earliest Portuguese settlements. In 1498 Vasco da Gama touched there, by invitation of the Kolattiri Raja on his way from Calicut. Three years after Cabral founded a factory. In 1502 Da Gama on his second voyage to India concluded a treaty with the Raja and left 200 Portuguese in Cannanore. The factory continued to flourish and in 1505 Almeyda was allowed to build a fort. In the next year he won a great naval victory in Cannanore bay over the Zamorin and his Mappillas, which finally established the Portuguese naval supremacy. The fort and factory continued in possession of the Portuguese till they were conquered by the Dutch in the middle of the 17th century. The Dutch held the fort till 1771, when they sold it to the Ali Raja whose power had considerably increased during Haidar Ali’s first invasion.
