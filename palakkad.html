          <h2>Palakkad</h2>
          <p>
            Palakkad is one of the fourteen districts of Kerala and has no coastal line. The district opens the state to the rest of the country through the Palakkad Gap with a width of 32 to 40 Kms. Its geographical position, historical background, educational status, tourism hot-spots and above all, the development activities that are carried out, are wide and varied. The district is one of the main granaries of Kerala and its economy is primarily agricultural. The district is also the land of Palmyrahs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The present Palakkad district, as an administrative unit,was formed on the first of January 1957, comprising of Palakad, Perinthalmanna, Ponnani, Ottapalam, Alathur and Chittur. Later when the Malappuram District was formed excluding Thritala firka of Ponnani Taluk, Mankada firka and excluding Karkidamkunnu & Chetalloor amsoms of Perinthelmanna Taluk are transferred to that district and a new taluk was formed namely Mannarkkad. In 2013, Ottapalam taluk was bifurcated and Pattambi taluk was formed.
          </p>
          <h2>History of Palakkad</h2>
          <p>
            The ancient history of Palakkad is shrouded in mystery. According to William Logan, the author of the Malabar Manual, the Pallava dynasty of Kanchi might have invaded Malabar in the second or third century AD. One of their headquarters was a place called ‘Palakada’ which could be the present-day Palakkad. Malabar had been invaded by many of the ancient South Indian rulers. For many centuries it was ruled by Perumals. They had under them some powerful ‘Utayavars’ who held authority in their respective territories. After the rule of Perumals, the country was divided among these chieftains. The Valluvakonathiri (ruler of Valluvanad), the rulers of Vengunad (Kollengodu Rajas) and Sekharivarma Rajas of Palakkad were the prominent rulers of this region after the Perumals.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the Zamorin of Calicut invaded Palakkad in 1757, the Raja of Palakkad sought the help of Hyder Ali of Mysore. Hyder Ali’s help forced the Zamorin to retreat. Later, Hyder Ali subjugated all territories in Palakkad which were under the possession of Zamorin. Thus the whole area possessed by the Raja of Palghat passed into the hands of the Mysore rulers, Hyder Ali and his son Tippu. The war between Tippu and the East India Company ended with the treaty of 1872 and all the possessions of Tippu in Malabar were ceded to the British. Gradually these formed part of the Malabar district of the Madras presidency.
          </p>
          <p>
            The present Palakkad district as an administrative unit was formed on the 1st of January 1957, consisting of the following taluks: Palakkad, Perinthalmanna, Ponnani, Ottapalam, Alathur and Chittur.

          <h2>Tourist Destinations</h2>
          <p>
            Palakkad, otherwise known by its anglicized name Palghat, is a district in Kerala that lies along the serpentine mountain ranges of the Western Ghats. What makes Palakkad distinct from other parts of Kerala is its predominantly rural nature coupled with enormous expanses of paddy fields. Endless stretch of palm trees, green carpeted landscapes, dense tropical forests and undulating hilly terrains make Palakkad a visual treat to spectators. By contributing massively to the rice production of Kerala, Palakkad has rightfully grabbed two titles - ‘The Rice Bowl of Kerala’ and ‘The Granary of Kerala’.
