          <h2>Idukki</h2>
          <p>
            Idukki is one of the 14 districts of Kerala state, India, created on 26 January 1972. This beautiful High range district of Kerala is geographically known for its Mountainous Hills and Dense Forests. For the people of Kerala, Idukki is always associated with Power Generation. About 66% of the Stateâ€™s Power needs come from the Hydroelectric Power Projects in Idukki.
          </p>
          <p>
            Idukki which lies in the Western Ghats of Kerala is the second largest district in area but has the lowest population density. Idukki has a vast forest reserve area; more than a half of the district is covered by forests. The urban areas are densely populated whereas villages are sparsely populated. Idukki is also known as the spice garden of Kerala.
          </p>
          <h2>History of Idukki</h2>
          <p>
            Though the district cannot boast of a history of the rise and fall of a few dynasties, it played a significant role in the spiritual development of the country, especially the south. The Ramayana gives a graphic description of the flora of the Pamba Valley.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is believed that the name Sabarimala derived from Sabari Ashram which was located at Sabari Peedom near Sabari Mala , one of the famous Pilgrim centres. The Lord Ayyappa Temple at Sabarimala is supposed to be the place where a great Jain or Buddhist monk attained Nirvana . (Now Sabarimala is in Pathanamthitta district). The archaeological evidence of the Mangaladevi Temple 15 kms. from Thekkadi in the dense forest bespeaks of an equally shrouded antiquity. May be, with its undulating hills and valleys and the perennial rivers the district formed a recluse for the spiritual seekers of ancient India.
          </p>
          <h2>Tourist Destinations</h2>
          <p>
            Mist laden hills, enchanting valleys, gushing streams, cascades, rolling grasslands, sprawling plantations, colonial bungalows, wildlife and many more makes Idukki, a landlocked district in Central Kerala a unique destination for travellers.
