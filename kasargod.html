          <h2>Kasargod</h2>
          <p>
            Lying at the northern tip of Kerala bounded by the Western ghats in the east and Arabian sea in the west; twelve rivers flowing across its terrain, Kasaragod is an enchanting beauty of Nature’s creations.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are different views on the derivation of the name “KASARAGOD”. One view is that it is the combination of two Sanskrit words kaasaara (which means lake or pond) and kroda (which means a place where treasure is kept). Another view is that it is the place where Kaasaraka trees (Strychnos nux vomica or Kaanjiram or Kaaraskara) are in abundance. Both views are relavant as there are large number of rivers, lakes and ponds in the coastal belt of the district besides thick flora consisting of innumerable varieties of trees, shribs etc. particularly plentitude of Kaasaraka trees.
          </p>
          <p>
            The landscape is dominated by the characteristic coconut palms accompanying rolling hills and streams flowing into the sea. The landscape is dotted with tiled-roof buildings, topped with the famous Kasaragod tiles made with the local hard red clay and typically walled with laterite blocks. Older houses are commonly found with elaborate woodwork.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are 12 rivers in this district.The longest is Chandragiri (105 kms) originating from Pattimala in Coorg and embraces the sea at Thalangara, near Kasargod. The river assumes its name Chandragiri from the name of the place of its source Chandragupta Vasti; where the great Maurya emperor Chandragupta is believed to have spent his last days as a sage.
          </p>
          <h2>History of Kasargod</h2>
          <p>
            Kasaragod was once known to the Arabs by the name Harkwillia.Kasaragod District was organised as a separate district on 24 May 1984. Kasaragod was an important trade center.Duarte Borbosa, the Portuguese traveler who visited Kumbla, near Kasaragod in 1514, recorded that rice was exported for coir to Maldives.Kasaragod was part of the Kumbala Kingdom in which there were 64 Tulu and Malayalam villages. On being attacked by the Vijayanagara empire, it was still under the Kolathiri Raja who had Nileshwaram as one of his capitals. During the decline of the Vijayanagara empire, the administration of this area was vested with Ikkery Naiks. With the downfall of the, Venkappa Naik declared independence to Ikkery. Kumbla, Chandragiri and Bekal are considered to be the chain of forts constructed or renovated by Shivappa Naik.
          </p>
          <p>
            Francis Buccanan, the family doctor of Arthur Wellesley, visited Kasaragod in 1800 had recorded information on places like Athiraparambu, Kavvai, Nileshwaram, Bekal, Chandragiri and Manjeshwaram. It was only in 1763 that Hyder Ali conquered Bedanoor , the capital of the Ikkery Naiks. His son Tippu Sultan conquered much of Malabar. As per the Sreerangapattanam Treaty of 1792, Tippu surrendered Malabar, except Tulunadu (Canara) to the British. The British got Tulunadu only after the death of Tippu Sultan.
